Please implement a minimal clone of the =ls= program. We have chosen this exercise as it will require you to use structs, pointers and arrays, as well as some C standard library functions with interesting interfaces. It will also likely to be substantial enough to merit some degree of code organization.

Minimally, it should list the contents of a directory including some information about each file, such as file size. As a stretch goal, use =man ls= to identify any interesting flags you may wish to support, and implement them.
